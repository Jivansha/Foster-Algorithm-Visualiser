# Foster-Algorithm-Visualiser

A desktop application to visualize certain algorithms to ease learning for students.
Foster is a GUI based learning platform based in C++ where different popular algorithms will be available for learning purpose for the user. It uses the knowledge of various algorithms and C++ language and Qt Creator to create a desktop application for the same.
This project is being developed under 4rt Edition of Learn It Girl Scholarship Program.

# Running the Application

To run the application go to the release section of this repository and download the execution and application extension files. After download make sure all these files are in the same folder. To run the application just run the Application (.exe) file.
